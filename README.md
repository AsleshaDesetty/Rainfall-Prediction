# Rainfall-Prediction
Predicting rainfall in Australia for the next day

The overall objective of the project is to predict rainfall in Australia for the next day. This involves the application of machine learning techniques to historical weather data. Potential features for prediction include temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and date-related information. The Algorithms used are KNN(k = 3, 5, 10), DecisionTree(CART), Gausian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, SVM, ANN, Random Forest and XGBoost, with XGBoost demonstrating the highest accuracy at 86.11 percent.
As the project progresses, further steps may include feature scaling, selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, training models, and evaluating their performance. The ultimate goal is to build a reliable model that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on the provided features. The insights gained from this project could be valuable for various applications, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
